# Market_Trends_Analysis

This project focuses on exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the `SampleSuperstore` dataset, which contains information about sales, profits, discounts, and more, of a fictitious store. Through this analysis, we seek to obtain valuable insights into sales performance in different segments, product categories and geographies.
